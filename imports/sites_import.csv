S03193	Oldenburg Dannau	\N	54.297	10.854	Germany	LA 77: the neolithic settlement site Oldenburg LA 77 is located on an elevation of the western Oldenburg rift valley, and has been investigated in six trenches, all of them displaying a concentration of finds and features on the southern side of the sloping area; particularly remarkable is the fact that the site contains terrestrial as well as wetland features and due to the exceedingly good preservation of organic material i.e., wooden stakes or posts (reference: online pdf, see site description .doc); archaeobotany: data taken from Kirleis  et al. 2011 in which several sites are described (i.e., specific details for Oldenburg aren't given) but Kirleis states that in general a standard sample size of about 10 l of sediment was taken; flotation was used with a mesh size of 0.3 mm; in her table 2 she lists taxa present in the 15 recently examined sites (incl ODLA77) with totals counts but not ubiquities; for Oldenburg she records that 19 samples (total volume: 93 litres) were analysed; very few ID notes in text; in the general discussion Kirleis notes that settlements show the highest concentrations of plant materials with up to 109 remains/10 l (all remains are charred): LA 191: in 1979 and 1980 part of a well-known Neolithic settlement site was investigated on island-like hills in the valley of the Oldenburger Graben; the first trial excavation took place in 1969 on the shore area of the former settlement (Hoika 1981); only one part of the site projects slightly beyond the sea, the rest was lying under water until construction of a drainage pump station 50 years ago - so preservation conditions at the site are good; the site is still under permanent pasture and large parts of the settlement area were apparently never ploughed; in 1979-80 there were extensions to the north side in area A and about 100 m2 could be studied and on the south side (Area B) a ditch profile of 46 m length was dug (see Hoika 1981, Fig. 1); remains of houses (bordered with post-holes) with internal stone lined hearths were found; extensive documentation of a layer of red burned clay was first discovered in the southern part of Area A (Fig. 2: A 1, 21, 31) and further concentrations of the red clay were uncovered in other parts of this area (A 22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33); a horseshoe-shaped band extensively distributed with this red clay was also found (Fig. 3) and within which was a deposit of charred plant remains; everything indicates that this part of the settlement was destroyed by fire and the horseshoe-shaped band red clay could be interpreted as the collapsed wall of a straw building; a second very thin layer of charcoal and a further red layer of clay were uncovered that correspond to a second building and fire phase; archaeobotany: 10 samples - each about a large bucket of source material (e.g., c.10 litres) from the most promising, most charcoal excavated areas were taken (all from Area A, see Hoika 1981 p56, Fig.2/3 for exact locations); these were washed on a 0.2 mm mesh and then put through a stack of sieves (5.0 to 0.2 mm mesh sizes) for sorting; the samples comprised largely charred remains but there were also some waterlogged taxa; a majority of taxa not preserved by charring are wet-loving species (e.g. non economic plants); in the d/base I've been consistent with other sites and entered all charred remains+ waterlogged taxa (e.g. fruits&nuts etc.) which had obviously been deliberately collected and brought to the site (e.g. Corylus, Fragaria, Malus, etc.); if a taxon is preserved by charring & waterlogging the ubiquity & total no relate to the former	\N	\N	2023-04-21 12:18:41	adrian@macelab-server.biochem.ucl.ac.uk

S01559	Claish Farm	Scotland	56.231	-4.204	Great Britain	a long timber-built Early Neolithic structure was excavated at this site (c. 24m x 8.5m). It was concluded that, while the structure may have been lived in, it was not a large 'farmhouse' and cannot be taken as a 'typical' settlement of the Early Neolithic in Scotland; Archaeobotany: Charred plant remains were recorded in 24 samples from post-holes, slot-trenches and internal pits. The samples were washed/processed with water, using a sieve of unknown mesh size. Cereal remains included emmer wheat, bread wheat and cf. 6-row hulled barley. Large quantities of hazelnut shell were recorded. The totals from C15 and C19 are >300 and >250 respectively. Crab-apple remains were also present in one deposit, as well as weeds in another deposit [hazel nut remains are present in all samples, all other taxa are only recorded in 6 samples; the 2 burnt pits contain the majority of remains]	\N	\N	2023-07-24 10:47:20	robert@localhost

S08852	Vivoin 'Le Parc'	\N	48.243	0.164	France	the commune of Vivoin stands on the left bank of the Sarthe north of the central depression occupied by the city of Le Mans; the site is c.1km to the northwest the commune of Vivoin, just behind the farm "the Gaudin" and is 72m asl in the northern part of the interfluve between the streams de la Vigne and Orthon - tributaries of the Sarthe; the full stratigraphy of the site was recorded at the edge of the cleared area - a depth of 1.50 to 2.25m in which 5 layers were defined (Neolithic evidence in layer 2); middle Neolithic 1 occupation is characterized by the establishment of a building around which there are several pits and fireplaces (an area exhaustively searched is 3225 m2 to a thickness of between 10-15cm); Neolithic hollow structures belong to three morphological types: the posthole structures are the most numerous (42 structures) and form the floor plan of the building; 3 ovens/hearths are located around the building; and pits usually difficult to identify and date divide into two areas, three are near the building, and two others are situated to the west of the cleared area; chronology: the site of Vivoin occupies a privileged place between the Chambon group and all the regional facies of Paris Basin and Normandy atributed to the  Cerny culture; archaeobotany: only 19 postholes produced charred plant remains (the volume of sediment taken for processing varied between 10-30L - see table ); the sediments were wet-sieved through a column of two sieves with mesh sizes of 2.0 and 0.5 mm; 672 plant macrofossils all charred were identified comprising 30 taxa of which half were assigned to the species level; D-S notes that the preservation of material is extremely mediocre; the richest fills were those of the post holes (50, 48, 47, 52, 54, 61) located in the axis of the southern entrance	\N	\N	2023-04-20 15:29:13	Rscripts@localhost

Chasseen), final Neolithic (c.4700-2600BC); archaeobotany: samples were taken during the recent excavation of the site between 2004-2008; volumes ranging from 0.8-20 litres were taken from each of the sedimentary facies of each level - analyses reported by LM were carried out on almost all the Neolithic sequence (d63-d122 levels) in the sheep pen - a total of 65 samples (total volume: 564.4L); each sample was allowed to settle in water for at least 12 hours and then wet-sieved on a column of three sieves (mesh size: 5 mm, 2 mm and 0.5 mm for screening done on site (levels d63-110) and 4 mm, 2 mm and 0.5 mm when screening was done at IPSA Basel (levels d112-122); all remains are charred and preservation overall is recorded as being good; I've entered data in table 2 in which fragments have been converted to 'whole grain/seed equivalents' (appendix 2 has full listing)	\N	\N	2023-10-16 08:36:17	jelena@localhost

S02017	GIRIBALDI CIMIEZ CARABACEL	\N	43.712	7.272	France	the site is located in the city of Nice at the southern border of the Cimiez plateau 1.8 km from the sea and 500m west of the river Paillon; it was discovered during the construction of a building and was excavated as part of a rescue programme by D. Binder and his team from March to June 1985 (Binder, 1989 and 1991); the excavation resulted in uncovering a series of sandy clays that were very rich in middle Neolithic remains; the majority of a/bot samples were from an area of 55 m2 belonging to a depression dug in the clay - this depression has produced detrital accumulations (structures 6A, 6B and 7) two wells (structures 3 and 7), as well as the edge of a structure that corresponds with an area of combustion (structure 1) [occupation dated between 5370-5095  BP]; archaeobotany: the plant macrofossils were collected by sieving (not stated whether this was dry- or wet-sieving) during the excavation on a 1 mm mesh (I assume all the plant rmains are charred); a/bot samples listed in table 1 are taken from structures 3, 6, 7 and from two auger holes; wood charcoal analysis led to the identification of 36 taxa that characterize four vegetation zones: mountainous, supramediterranean, lower mesomediterranean and riparian vegetation; 918 (non wood-charcoal) plant remains were identified comprising 29 taxa; Thiebault et al. note that in structure 6B there were fragments of cereal/grain 'cake; potentially edible species are represented in the wood charcoal but not in macro-remains (e.g., Olea, Juglans, Sorbus aria, etc.) [the authors do CA on the remains and note that samples/levels form 4 distinct(?) chronological groups - they interpret these as being characteristic of different vegetation zones/plant resources (e.g., wood for fuel/wild edible plants) that were exploited over time during the occupation; they also suggest that the presence of Olea charcoal is indicative of a period of aridity at teh end of the middle Neolithic occupation]	\N	\N	2023-04-20 15:14:30	adrian@localhost

S09211	Vrold	\N	56.028	9.885	Denmark	in the fall of 2010, the Skanderborg Museum completed an archaeological excavation of a 6800 m2 area in Vrold; the excavations uncovered 5-7 houses, two of which are possible Neolithic midtsulehus? and one a sunken house site from the early Bronze Age; samples were processed at Moesgaard  museum; Late Neolithic (sample X10): 3 sub-samples were taken from grain finds X10- in the present investigation just one sample of 3 x10 subsamples are analyzed; X10 is selected from the pit A584 which is located in field immediately south of a possible Neolithic midtsulehus?; the pit consists of several layers, and the dark bottom layer was filled with charred organic material - indicative of burning in situ; two 14C dates of charred cereal grains of emmer (Triticum dicoccum) from x10 both dated the pit between 1900-2000 BC - i.e., the layer is attributable to the Late Neolithic; 2 samples from the EBA house are examined: X42 - this sample was taken from the fill in the recessed portion of the longhouse K5; the sample is likely to reflect plant material that has accumulated during the period of use of the building; 2 initial 14C dates of a sample of barley (Hordeum vulgare sp.) and indeterminate grains (Cerealia indet.) gave dates spanning approx. 1500-1770 BC indicating that X42 is from the oldest part of the Bronze Age; X47 is taken from a pit (A1135) in the northern corner of the longhouse K5; the pit is interpreted as a probable basement pit that belonged to the longhouse; 2 initial 14C dates of cereal grains, respectively emmer/spelt and naked barley provided dates spanning the period ca. 1600-1750 BC which corresponds well to the date of x42, confirming the connection between the two areas/contexts	\N	\N	\N	\N

S08864	Clairvaux, Station III	\N	46.570	5.749	France	Station III is located immediately south of the reedbed which borders to the west of the peninsula of peat of the Motte aux Magnin (on the Grand Lac at Clairvaux); Station III was identified in 1870 by J. Le Mire - in 1970 and 1971, as part of the systematic exploration of Lake Clairvaux we were able undertake a new investigation of this station, occupying a sandbank to the southwest of the Motte aux Magnins; the site is still immersed covered by a layer of water to 0.60 1.40 m below the lake and the remains of wooden piles cover an area of approximately 300 m2; to the north, the side land, the site is covered by a reedbed, which mask the surface archaeological deposits; 14C and dendro dates + artefactual evidence place the occupation in the Saone Rhone culture of the final Neolithic [several occupation phases are represented at the site - all FNeo]; archaeobotany: a majority of the plant remains preserved at Station III are waterlogged; systematic sampling at the site took two forms: the first involved  on-site coarse sieving (mesh sizes 4mm, 2mm) all excavated sediments (reports on the taxa identified by Erroux, Hopf and L-B are included in a separate chapter in the Petrequin publication), the second was fine (wet/)sieving in the lab of samples taken from 3 column profiles (columns: 3, 6, 10) with mesh sizes of 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5mm); data entered in db relate to the latter samples (recorded in ch 32/appendix 2) identified by L-B; she notes that the columns were subsampled according to stratigraphic levels - resulting in 27 samples each of c.400g; my translation of rich 'peaty' layers is 'organic lacustrine manure' - presumably reference to occupation debris (plant and otherwise) - all profiles were taken through these deposits but column 6 seemed to best represent the thickest organic layers; there is also evidence of burning in several layers; I've amalgamated records from all 3 columns as listed in appendix 2; Note: a majority of taxa not preserved by charring are wet-loving species (e.g. non economic plants); in the d/base I've been consistent with other sites & entered all charred remains+ waterlogged taxa (e.g. fruits&nuts etc.) which had obviously been deliberately collected & brought to the site (e.g. Corylus, Fragaria, Malus, etc.); if a taxon is preserved by charring & waterlogging the ubiquity & total no relate to the former	\N	\N	\N	\N

Houdre; plant remains were recovered from a large pit (20 x 20 m) probably of natural origin and filled with a thick ashy sediment (and located on scree slope adjacent to the river); all deposits revealed Chasseen artefacts - some vestiges of structures remain (post holes, etc.) but few habitation floors and it was so impossible to perceive the role of functional site (habitatation, dump, etc.); ceramics and some bone material date the occupation phase to recent Chasseen Vellave and correlate to level 3 and 4 Rivaux which confirms the 4 radiocarbon dates (see report for details); archaeobotany: plant remains (all charred) were observed at the excavation at all levels however, lower layers seemed richer; wieving, either dry or wet according to circumstances on a coarse mesh sieve (?size not specified) facilitated retrieval of some of these remains - Bouby notes that the operation was not systematic; later in the text he states that for several of the samples it was possible to use a fine(r) sieve and volumes of sediments processed in this way are recorded; in table 2 the taxa from this sieving exercise are listed - I've assumed that these taxa have already been included in the overall totals shown in table 1 (on the basis that numbers of items are exactly the same in both tables for some of the samples)	\N	\N	2024-10-21 11:02:24	jelena@localhost

S08952	Keinsmerbrug	\N	52.811	4.799	Netherlands	the site was first investigated in 1985 by F. Diederik using a single test pit - followed a year by later Van Haaff who conducted a full excavation prior to the site's destruction for bulb production; in 1986 the site was divided into 4 quadrants separated by a 1m baulk - each quadrant was stripped of topsoil down to a depth of 6-70cm (excavation was done in m2); most of the Neolithic features were in trench 3; the pits (n=25) are the earliest anthropogenic feature at the site - they show signs of rapid backfilling and contain few finds - many were waterlogged during excavation; the cultural layer fills the tops of many of the pits above the natural backfill - the layer is up to 20cm thick and comprises at least a few habitation phases; within this layer 5 charcoal areas have been interpreted as hearths; cattle hoof marks cut into few of these hearths and are present below others; postholes and stakes (n=666) form the majority of features at the site; there are also 4 possible plough marks - there is uncertainty about the contemporaneity of these with the LNeo occupation; archaeobotany: samples were taken during the 1986 excavation; with the exception of 2 samples that were taken from possible wells all other samples derive from the occupation layer; the samples were collected on a 1m2 grid and within the c.20cm occuption layer; only the SE part of the site was sampled systematically while other areas were sampled more randomly; in total 87 samples were taken (vols: 1.5-3L); samples were wet-sieved on a 0.25mm mesh; a total of 18 samples was selected for fully analysis - with the exception of waterlogged remains recovered from the wells (features 1001, 1003) all the remains from the occupation deposits were charred; all samples were from trenches 3&4; as with other sites I've entered charred remains (and noted if taxa are also found in waterlogged form) and waterlogged taxa that are known to be edible (as in PFAF) - all other waterlogged remains are omitted from db entries [all data taken from Appendix III] [KM notes several lumps of 'processed food and also organic residues encrusted on pottery -the organic lumps revealed seeds and grains embedded in the matrix]	\N	\N	\N	\N

Muller; underwater excavations followed between 1972 and 1986 and were carried out by the 'Centre de Documentation de la Prehistoire Alpine'; since 1972, one month per year has been devoted to the excavation of a late Neolithic village spread over 1500 m 2; two occupation levels are separated by a sterile layer - dendro dating, etc., has established that each phase of occupation lasted between 20-30 years; archaeobotany: records entered in db are taken from table 3 in online report in which taxa identified in 'column Y' are listed (all publications I could find for 'Les Baigneurs' state that the a/bot reports are preliminary); L-B notes that her online report covers the latter aspect of the work at the site (since 1980); the descriptions relate to a sediment block corresponding to 2 triangles (the site was excavated on a triangular grid) 50cm thick and weighing more than 600kg; fine sampling was carried out - 6 samples were taken for studying macro-remains; 400g of each of these samples were wet-sieved on meshes of 8, 4, 2, 1 ,0.5mm (only small amounts of the finer fractions were sorted); a majority of the plant remains (including wood and seeds, etc.) was waterlogged with only few charred taxa; the 6 samples from column Y contained over 29,000 seeds [in the 1986 report L-B clearly states that the plant remains from the 2 occupation phases are amalgamaged]; Note: a majority of taxa not preserved by charring are wet-loving species (e.g. non economic plants); in the d/base I've been consistent with other sites & entered all charred remains+ waterlogged taxa (e.g. fruits&nuts etc.) which had obviously been deliberately collected & brought to the site (e.g. Corylus, Fragaria, Malus, etc.); if a taxon is preserved by charring & waterlogging the ubiquity & total no relate to the former	\N	\N	\N	\N
